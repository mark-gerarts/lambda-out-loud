Hi! Lambda Out Loud is a blog about all things code. You'll see posts here
ranging from tutorials to just some interesting things I came across.


## About me
In my day job I write web applications, with PHP being my language of choice.
For my side projects, however, I like experimenting with all sorts of
programming languages and technologies. As you might expect from the name of
this blog, I prefer functional languages.

## Contributing
As a huge fan of open source software, this blog is open source as well. If you
spot any typos, have any suggestions, or if you want to improve a post, feel
free to [open an issue](#) or [pull request](#).
