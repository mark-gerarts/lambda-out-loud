```
bash: gti: command not found
```

Does this error message look familiar? I often type faster than my skills allow,
resulting in a lot of typos. As a remedy, I maintain a long list of "aliases of
shame":

```bash
alias sl="ls"
alias it="git"
alias gti="git"
alias gut="git"
alias got="git"
alias code.="code ."
# ...and so on
```
