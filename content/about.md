Lambda Out Loud is a blog about all things code. You'll see posts here ranging
from tutorials to just some interesting things I came across, along with a
section dedicated to creative coding.

If you spot any typos, have any suggestions, or if you want to improve a post,
feel free to [open an issue or pull
request](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/lambda-out-loud).
