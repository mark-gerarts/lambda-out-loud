My name is Mark, I'm from the tiny speck on the globe known as Belgium. My
career has seen some changes: I moved from software development to data
engineering and ended up as a developer/bioinformatician at a local hospital.
Now I am starting a PhD in Computer Science at Hasselt University.

I love all things related to computer science, coding, Linux, and OSS --- hence
this blog. I also enjoy the occasional video game, which means I spend more time
behind a screen than I'd like. When I get the chance, you can find me outdoors:
running (I'm casually building up to a marathon), cycling (to keep up for my
yearly bikepacking trip), and going to local concerts. I also enjoy noodling on
my guitar and watching movies (80's horror movies are my guilty pleasure).

This blog was initially a place for me to write down all things related to code
--- tutorials, interesting snippets, Linux stuff, and so on. As I have learned
to appreciate writing as a way to shape and order my thoughts, I will probably
include more general and personal posts soon&trade;.
