My name is Mark, I'm from the tiny speck on the globe known as Belgium. My
career has seen some changes: I moved from software development to data
engineering and ended up as a developer/bioinformatician at a local hospital.
Now I am starting a PhD in Computer Science at Hasselt University.

This blog was initially a place for me to write down all things related to code
--- tutorials, interesting snippets, Linux stuff, and so on. As I have learned
to appreciate writing as a way to shape and order my thoughts, I will probably
include more general and personal posts soon&trade;.

If you spot any typos, have any suggestions, or if you want to improve a post,
feel free to [open an issue or pull
request](https://github.com/mark-gerarts/lambda-out-loud) or drop me an
[e-mail](mailto:mark.gerarts+lambda@gmail.com).

This site was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and
