    <section>
      <p>Every once in a while I find myself returning to creative coding. Previously I
used <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5js</a> with <a href="https://github.com/Gaweph/p5-typescript-starter">TypeScript</a> for this. Browsersync&rsquo;s hot reloading combined
with the excellent Processing environment makes for a really pleasant developer
experience.</p>
<p>This time, however, I wanted to use creative coding as a way to learn and
improve my knowledge of functional programming. There are a number of options
out there:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>&rsquo;s most promising library for creative coding seems to be <a href="http://gloss.ouroborus.net/">gloss</a>.
It is stable and maintained, and has a few examples to get you started.
Closely related is <a href="https://github.com/fgaz/shine">Shine</a>, which brings gloss to the browser.</li>
<li><strong>PureScript</strong> has a <a href="https://github.com/derektmueller/purescript-p5">nice library</a> that provides p5js
bindings. The author even published a <a href="https://github.com/derektmueller/purescript-p5-boilerplate">boilerplate
project</a> that includes hot reloading.</li>
<li>Another nice sketching library is <strong>Clojure</strong>&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.quil.info/">Quil</a>. It&rsquo;s intuitive, has
good documentation, and is pleasant to work with. Coding is interactive, with
changes being compiled quickly.</li>
<li>For <strong>Common Lisp</strong> I can wholeheartedly recommend <a href="https://github.com/borodust/trivial-gamekit">trivial-gamekit</a>. It&rsquo;s
technically a library to create 2D games, but it lends itself really well for
creating sketches. You get an easy-to-use library combined with all the power
Lisp has to offer.</li>
<li>For a lightweight Haskell-like experience, there&rsquo;s <strong>Elm</strong>. <a href="https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/joakin/elm-canvas/latest/">Elm-canvas</a>
provides a nice wrapper around the HTML5 canvas, which is enough to get you
started.</li>
</ul>
<p>After briefly trying all these options I decided to spend some time to learn
Elm. It&rsquo;s <em>extremely</em> beginner friendly, allowing me to pick up functional
concepts at my own pace. <a href="https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live">Elm-live</a> provides hot reloading, which makes for a
very satisfying development workflow combined with the always helpful compiler.
Elm does lack some powerful and intriguing concepts that are present in Haskell
and PureScript, so at some point I&rsquo;ll probably find myself wanting to dig deeper
into those. But until then Elm has plenty of learning opportunities to offer.</p>
<p>A thing I like to do when learning a language is to follow along with <a href="https://natureofcode.com/">Nature of
Code</a>. Not only do you need to familiarize yourself with the
syntax, it forces you to explore various libraries as well. It&rsquo;s been a very
pleasant learning experience so far; you can follow the progress
